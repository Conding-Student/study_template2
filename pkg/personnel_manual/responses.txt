7.7.2 Basic Information on HIV/AIDS

What is AIDS?
It is a disease caused by a virus called Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). This virus slowly weakens a person’s ability to fight off other diseases by attaching itself to and destroying important cells that control and support the human immune system.

How HIV/AIDS is transmitted?
* Unprotected sex with an HIV infected person;
* From an infected mother to her child (during pregnancy or at birth through breast feeding);
* Intravenous drug use with contaminated needles;
* Transfusion with infected blood and blood products; and
* Unsafe, unprotected contact with infected blood and bleeding wounds of an infected person. 
Is there a cure?
No. However, there are antiretroviral drug combinations that are available when properly used which result in prolonged survival of people with HIV. Holistic care of people with HIV-AIDS and comprehensive treatment of opportunistic infections also dramatically improve their quality of life.

3.1 STRENGTHENING INTERNAL CONTROL SYSTEM

POLICY:

CARD as Mutually Reinforcing Institutions recognize the importance of internal control as a primary factor to continuity and success of the institutions. Strict compliance with policies and procedures is a pre-requisite to ensure control and that recurring findings and lapses should not be tolerated and should be avoided. In this light, it is the policy of the CARD MRI to impose internal control measures through imposing performance demerit points and disciplinary action when findings warrant such action. Implementation of such policy aims 
to:

*  Ensure awareness and cooperation among staff and officer to consistently achieve quality in maintaining internal controls
*  Encourage staff and officer to do best and excel and recognize their achievements
*  Serve as a means to safeguard the institution from risk of internal control breakdown





[SICS Guidelines]
CHAPTER 4: CODE OF DISCIPLINE

SECTION 3. INTERNAL CONTROL MEASURES

3.1 STRENGTHENING INTERNAL CONTROL SYSTEM

GUIDELINES/PROCEDURES:

1. Demerits Points shall be imposed and directly implemented by the respective supervisors to the staff/officers under their direct supervision. In case the findings was found out by the AM or RD or from Head Office Monitoring which was not yet found out by the immediate supervisor (UM), findings will be discussed and hand over to the UM for proper implementation on penalty. 

2. Demerits imposed shall be given and equally divided among the staff/officers involved or to all those staff/officers that are found accountable to the findings. Example: Findings of the AM for transactions released without proper approval as the transaction should be elevated for approval by the AM: Equivalent points of demerit points shall shared by the UM and AO involved in the findings on lapses.

3. For instances where supervisor does not comply in implementing demerit points, findings on lapses found out by the next immediate supervisor shall be given solely to the concerned supervisor who failed to comply. Example: A.) AM found out that UM does not apply demerits points on findings on lapses of the AO, the UM concerned shall be the one to be charged of the demerits points. B.) If RH found out that AM does not apply demerit points on findings on lapses at the unit committed by the AO, the AM concerned shall be the one to be charged of the demerit points twice (at the AO level and at the UM level).

4. Demerit Point shall be made immediately after detection and discussion with the concern person and should be recorded in corresponding log book record on Findings per unit, per Area or per Regional record.

5. HRD Unit receives and consolidates individual performance demerit points from the Area Level through the Area Manager and from the Head Office Level through the immediate supervisor on a monthly basis. It is then necessary that designated officers submits report to the respective HRD assigned regularly on a monthly basis based on the deadline of reports regularly submitted at the Head Office. This form part of the regular reporting and monitoring at the Head Office Level. (Refer to Annex form on Summary of Committed Lapses Report)

6. HRD keeps records, facilitates and coordinates for actions and monitor individual progress.

7. Computed demerits of staff is reviewed based on the level of risk the staff has caused weakness in the internal control system. Hence, quality of the staff job performance indicates whether he/she has contributed or not to the protection of internal control based on the level of risk of his/her committed lapses.

8. Individual Result of Demerit Points is reviewed at the HRD and based on the consolidated total points committed (low to high points), action shall be facilitated.

9. On the other hand, merit is when the staff has not contributed to the risk but instead has exhibited quality job performance in protecting and adhering to internal control system.

10. Based on the Demerit Result as consolidated from the HRD, action for HRD facilitation are as follows:

Please type "HRD facilitation" to view action for HRD facilitation.

11. Implementation of this policy does not exempt staff/officers for necessary disciplinary measures as provided in the code of discipline on the Personnel Manual. Recurring lapses of the staff which impact and consequence would be disadvantageous to the institution and which could foster potential material risk is considered negligence on his part, which case is now considered an offense. It is then but necessary that such negligence committed by staff has to be dealt with through proper administrative disciplinary action.

SECTION 6. HANDLING PERSONNEL DISCIPLINE CIRCUMSTANCES

6.1 GENERAL PROCEDURE

POLICY:

Objectivity and compliance to prescribed procedure must always be observed in handling all related disciplinary action concerning personnel discipline. Immediate Supervisor shall take responsibility in taking initiatives in coordinating and resolving any impact or concerns as a consequence of the committed offenses. Administrative charges and Legal action shall be pursued as deemed appropriate and warranted.

GUIDELINES/PROCEDURES:

1. In case of irregularities, all managers and officers should be aware of the dual effect of the problem: Resolution of the operational problem and addressing the problem to the staff concerned through personnel discipline procedure. 
o  Resolution of the case does not mean solving the damage or problem to the operations alone. Example. Case of unauthorized CBU withdrawal is resolved with the members as the staff settled his/her obligations/accountability but he/she has to be given appropriate disciplinary action as well.
o  Transfer of staff to another office or Unit should be taken carefully and should not be confused as disciplinary action for the staff. The staff should still have to be subjected to proper disciplinary action. 

2. All staff related problem shall have to be properly addressed to him/her supported with proper documentation which should also have to be submitted to the Personnel Office on time: 
o  for proper information of the staff on the wrong doings he/she committed in order for the staff to be aware of what improvement he/she needs to do.
o  for appropriate reference of CARD for all related staff program and policies
